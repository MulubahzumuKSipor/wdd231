                            <p>
                                Paynesville (sometimes Paynesward) is a suburb east of Monrovia, Liberia. It is geographically larger than the city of Monrovia. It is expanding eastward along the Robertsfield Highway and northeastward beyond Red Light Market, one of the largest market areas in Liberia. Paynesville is often considered a part of the Greater Monrovia area. It was the location of the Paynesville Omega Transmitter, the highest structure in Africa, until the tower's demolition in 2011. The Liberia Broadcasting System is also located in Paynesville.[1] The Liberian Judo Federation is based in Paynesville.
